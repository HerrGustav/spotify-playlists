# spotify-playlists
An automated way of creating playlists on spotify.

## Note:

This is just some playing around with the [spotify web api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
If you are looking for a helpful golang lib, that represents the spotify api [this is probably what you are looking for](https://github.com/zmb3/spotify). 

## Tests
You can run all tests by running:

```sh
make test
```
